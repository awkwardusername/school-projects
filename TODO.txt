GenusIDE is a WIP.

To open that thing called GenusIDE.sln, you need Visual Studio 2012. Well, there are some reports that tell me it works in VS 2010 too but they need to open the project using the GenusIDE.csproj file inside school-projects\GenusIDE folder.

Where am I?
- Icons! Yes!
- UI (and that sexy about box by @Temoto-kun)
- ScintillaNET integration, partly implemented
- friggin TABS!!! XD
- superb tabs! (repeated because important. :3)
- it can now compile using your favorite VS 2010 (although 2012 is recommended)

Where will I be?
- full ScintillaNET integration
- better documentation
- hotkeys for everything
- custom language definition
- compiler integration
- colors. yes. that blinkenlights.
