GenusIDE - a generic IDE [under development! :D]

An Integrated Development Environment for C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, HTML, Okashi, 
MOE, and any other programming language (as long as you configure it to do so) 
without the annoyances of fancy scrollbars, fancy UI, sparkling methods and 
functions, automagical refactoring, and splash screens.

Has the following features:
	- syntax (friggin) highlighting
	- code (friggin) completion
	- tabbed (friggin) pages
	- instant (friggin) compiler integration [with C, C++, C#, Okashi, MOE, and Java]
	- (friggin) hotkeys for almost everything
	- code (friggin) color printing
	- configurable syntax schemes and code completion features
	- lightweight (srsly!)!
	
Requires:
	- .NET Framework 4
	- Windows XP SP3+
	- 512 MB RAM (erm, recommended but it is .NET's requirements)
	- 1GHz CPU (it runs on netbooks!)
