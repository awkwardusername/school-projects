GenusIDE - a generic IDE [under development! :D]

An Integrated Development Environment for C, C++, C#, HTML, without the annoyances of fancy scrollbars, fancy UI, sparkling methods and functions, automagical refactoring, and splash screens.

Has the following features:
	- syntax (friggin) highlighting
	- code (friggin) completion
	- tabbed (friggin) pages
	- (friggin) hotkeys for almost everything
	- code (friggin) color printing
	- configurable syntax schemes and code completion features
	- lightweight (srsly!)!
	
Requires:
	- .NET Framework 4
	- Windows XP SP3+
	- 512 MB RAM (erm, recommended but it is .NET's requirements)
	- 1GHz CPU (it runs on netbooks!)
